# LLM-VM

This is an LLM agnostic JIT for natural language. Specifically, it uses LLMs to convert conversational natural language into a dynamic series of LLM and IO commands. You provide the underlying provider(s), actions (APIs, code-hooks) and their descriptions, data-sources (PDFs, websites...), and the LLM-VM will take care of load-balancing, fine-tuning, natural language compilation and tool-selection.

This is still in BETA.  Very little attention has been paid to package structure.  Expect it to change.

## Running/Testing

To run and test this repository you need to start a flask server. To start the flask server use: 

```bash
pip3 install .
llm_vm_server
```

This will start a flask server as http://192.168.1.75:3002 and will create an endpoint http://192.168.1.75:3002/completion. Post requests can be sent to this endpoint in the following format:

```
{
    "prompt":"What is 2+2",
    "context":"Answer the math problem with just a number.",
    "openai_key": <OPENAI-KEY>,
    "temperature":0,
    "finetune": true,
    "data_synthesis: true
}
```
If no temperature, finetune, or data_synthesis are provided, these values will default to 0, false, and false. 

To use the REBEL endpoint with tools, add a tool in the following way. We have used the finnhub api to get stocks data as an example. 
```
{
    "prompt":"What is the price of apple stock?",
    "context":"",
    "tools":[{
        "description":"Find the current price of a stock.",
        "url":"https://finnhub.io/api/v1/quote",
        "dynamic_params":{"symbol": "the symbol of the stock"},
        "method":"GET",
        "static_params":{"token":<Finnhub Key>}
    }],
    "openai_key": <OpenAI Key>,
    "temperature":0,
    "finetune": true
}

```
To access the completion endpoint programmatically, after starting up the server on your machine, import llm_vm.py into your code and call the completion function. Currently, we do not support tools through the programmatic completion function. To test that the server is working correctly, after starting it, run 
```
python test_llm_vm.py
```
### Optimizing Text Generation

The code in `src/llm_vm/completion/` provides an optimizing text generation framework. It allows storing models and fine-tuning them on new data to improve generations over time.

#### Files

- `optimize.py` - Provides the `Optimizer` abstract class and implementations for local optimization (using a `local_ephemeral` store) and hosted optimization (using OpenAI's API).
- `test_optimize.py` - A test file that shows using either the local or hosted optimizer to generate Haskell code and improve over time.

#### Usage

To use the local optimizer:

```python
from optimize import LocalOptimizer

optimizer = LocalOptimizer(MIN_TRAIN_EXS=2)  # Require 2 examples before fine-tuning a new model

completion = optimizer.complete(
    "Please convert this line to some haskell:", # Description of the task
    "x = 5",   # Prompt to complete
    max_tokens=100, 
    temperature=0.0
)
print(completion)
# Haskell:
# x = 5
```

To use the hosted optimizer:

```python
from optimize import HostedOptimizer
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

optimizer = HostedOptimizer(anarchy_key=os.getenv('ANARCHY_KEY'), openai_key=os.getenv('OPENAI_KEY'), MIN_TRAIN_EXS=2)  

completion = optimizer.complete(
    "Please convert this line to some haskell:", 
    "x = 5",
    max_tokens=100, 
    temperature=0.0
)
print(completion)
# Haskell:  
# x = 5
```

There are three agents: FLAT, REBEL, and BACKWARD_CHAINING. 

Run the agents separately by going into the `src/llm_vm/agents/<AGENT_FOLDER>` and running the file that is 
titled `agent.py`. 

Alternatively, to run a simple interface and choose an agent to run from the CLI, run the `src/llm_vm/agents/agent_interface.py` file 
and follow the command prompt instructions.
