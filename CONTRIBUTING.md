We know contributing can be daunting, but we're here to help.  Your contributions are essential to keeping anarchy alive, and we want you to succeed. Be annoying! Ask us for help! Ask each other for help! :pray:

Anybody can submit PRs!  *Anybody.*  We *want* to accept them all, but simply can't.  We don't want you to work in vain, so we kindly request you **communicate** with us.  File tickets (even dumb ones) & tell us what you want to do in discord & on tickets comments.

# QUICKSTART

1. Join the [discord](https://discord.anarchy.ai) and read the #constitution.

2. Download and run the [code](https://code.anarchy.ai). If anything is annoying, hard, confusing, or broken, file a ticket!

3. Check out the open issues that are [good for beginners](https://github.com/anarchy-ai/LLM-VM/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).  Pick one and comment on it, and write in #engineering that you are interested in it.  You can't be assigned it quite yet - you need to become a full contributor first (#roles-and-levels)!

4. When you are ready to finally commit, you'll have to make a pull request by forking the code.  Mention the ticket number your pull request addresses in the issue.  Write "Closes #136"

5. Join the weekly ticket triage on Monday to learn more about the issues and speak to me directly!


# Bounty Program

Some tickets we'll pay you for closing! Look at the [ticket](https://github.com/anarchy-ai/LLM-VM/issues) labels to see how much the bounty is.

* Post your email address (can be a burner one) on the closed ticket, and from the same account email juliet@anarchy.ai/ping her on discord @keynai.
* You will receive payout via paypal.
* PR must be approved by team, and ticket must remain closed for 1 full week.
* Some tickets are vague - determining what "closes" them is at the discretion of the anarchy team.

# SWAG

If a ticket has the SWAG tag, you'll get a discount code for up to $50 of free swag from our [swag-shop](https://swag.anarchy.ai/)
