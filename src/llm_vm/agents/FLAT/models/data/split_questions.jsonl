The host plant provides a root system and a base for the scion to grow on. Over time, the two plants grow together and form a single plant with the desirable traits of the scion and the root system of the host plant. Grafting is commonly used in fruit tree production, ornamental plants, and for creating disease-resistant plants.</ANSWER>\n</INTERACTION><INTERACTION>\n<QUESTION>I see, so you can have a plant that makes two fruits?</QUESTION>\n<ANSWER>Yes, it is possible to have a plant that produces two different types of fruit by grafting a scion from one fruit tree onto the rootstock of another fruit tree. For example, it is possible to have a tree that produces both apples and pears, or a tree that produces both lemons and oranges, by grafting different scions onto the same rootstock.</ANSWER>\n</INTERACTION></CONVERSATION-HISTORY>\n<QUESTION>Make a 30 word summary and email it to Mark</QUESTION>\n<ANSWER>", "completion": "Summarize grafting in 30 words|||Email that to Mark</ANSWER>\n</SPLIT>"}
